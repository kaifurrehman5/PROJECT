                <h1>CONTROLS FOR DO-NOT-TRACK FEATURES</h1>
                <br>
                <p>Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile applications include a Do-Not-Track ('DNT') feature or setting you can activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data about your online browsing activities monitored and collected. At this stage, no uniform technology standard for recognising and implementing DNT signals has been finalised. As such, we do not currently respond to DNT browser signals or any other mechanism that automatically communicates your choice not to be tracked online. If a standard for online tracking is adopted that we must follow in the future, we will inform you about that practice in a revised version of this Privacy Notice.</p>

                <h1>DO WE ASK FULL PAYMENT BEFORE SUBMISSION?</h1>
                <br>
                <p>To ensure a smooth and successful project delivery, we kindly request a 45% payment in advance. This initial payment enables us to initiate the project and allocate necessary resources. Upon completion of the project, we will share the visuals of your finished work for your review and approval. This ensures that you're completely satisfied with the outcome before proceeding. Once you've approved the completed project, we'll request the remaining 55% payment. Please note that the final payment is due upon approval, and not upon submission of the project. Upon receipt of the final payment, we'll deliver your complete project, ensuring that you receive the high-quality outcome you deserve.</p>

                <h1>DO WE MAKE UPDATES TO THIS NOTICE?</h1>
                <br>
                <p>In Short: Yes, we will update this notice as necessary to stay compliant with relevant laws.</p>
                <p>We may update this Privacy Notice from time to time. The updated version will be indicated by an updated 'Revised' date at the top of this Privacy Notice. If we make material changes to this Privacy Notice, we may notify you either by prominently posting a notice of such changes or by directly sending you a notification. We encourage you to review this Privacy Notice frequently to be informed of how we are protecting your information.</p>
